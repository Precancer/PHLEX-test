Segmentation with Deep-imcyto
*****************************

Deep-imcyto is a deep learning based software pipeline for the identification of cells and nuclei in imaging  mass cytometry (IMC) data. 
It is based on the U-Net++ architecture and is trained on the TRACERx nuclear IMC dataset consisting of 40,000+ nuclei from IMC images of lung and other tissue types. 

The tool is available as a docker image and can be run on any machine with a GPU.
