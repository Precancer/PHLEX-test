TRACERx-PHLEX - cell PHenotype and Location analysis of multiplEX imaging

===================================

**TRACERx-PHLEX** is a modular pipeline for comprehensive analysis of the tumour microenvironment using multiplex imaging.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

TRACERx-PHLEX contains three submodules, each devoted to a different problem in multiplex image processing:


#. :ref:`PHLEX:Deep-imcyto<imcyto_anchor>`

   A module devoted to performign accurate nuclear and cellular segmentation in multiplex images.

#. :ref:`PHLEX:TYPEx<TYPEx_anchor>`

   A module for cellular phenotyping from marker expression intensities derived from multiplex images.

#. :ref:`Spatial-PHLEX`

   A module for performing several types of automated spatial analysis.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
