TRACERx-PHLEX - cell PHenotype and Location analysis of multiplEX imaging
=========================================================================

**TRACERx-PHLEX** is a modular pipeline for comprehensive analysis of the tumour microenvironment using multiplex imaging.

Check out the :ref:`installation` and :ref:`quickstart` guides for information on how to get started with TRACERx-PHLEX.

TRACERx-PHLEX contains three submodules, each devoted to a different problem in multiplex image processing:


** - :ref:`PHLEX:Deep-imcyto<imcyto_anchor>`**

      Nuclear and cellular segmentation in multiplex images.

** - :ref:`PHLEX:TYPEx<TYPEx_anchor>`**

      Cellular phenotyping from marker expression intensities derived from multiplex images.

** - :ref:`Spatial-PHLEX`**

      Automated spatial analysis of cell coordinate data.
